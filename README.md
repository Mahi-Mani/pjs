## Code Snippet
```Javascript
// hashing password /encrypting
     app.put("/api/user/", function (req, res) {
        var pw = req.body.password;
        db.users.findAll({
            where: {
                email: req.body.email
            }
        }).then(function(data) {
            if (pw) {
                var hash = data[0].dataValues.password;
                bcrypt.compare(pw, hash, function(err, conf) {
                    if (err) throw err;

                    if (conf) {
                        res.json(data)
                    } else {
                        res.send(conf)
                    }
                })
            } else {
                res.json(data);
            }
        }).catch(function(err) {
            console.log(err)
        })
    })
```
>Used BCrypt library to hash password

```Javascript
// Get employee profile based on city name
    app.get("/api/new/profile/:cityName", function (req, res) {
        var cityName = req.params.cityName;

        db.Profile.findAll({
            where: {
                city: cityName
            }
        }).then(function (result) {
            console.log(result);
            res.json(result);
        });
    })
```
> This is basically a search query to search a particular profile based on a city name

```Javascript
// Associating jobs with many statuses
    Job.associate = function(models) {
        models.Job.hasMany(models.Status, { foreignkey: "jobId", sourceKey: "id" });
    };
    
    return Job;
}
```
> Job model has many relationships with Status table for application to keep track of all Applied/Saved jobs
```Javascript
// Creating new employer with Ajax method POST
       $.ajax("/api/new/employer", {
            type: "POST",
            data: newEmployer
        }).then(function (result) {
            console.log(result);
            console.log("New employer created");
            // To reload the page
            // location.reload();
            displayAllPosts();
            $("#j-post").modal("toggle");

        })
```
> Code snippet to create new employer when he/she is logged in
```Javascript
    // All accepted candidates
    app.get("/api/all/accepted/:employerId", function (req, res) {
        db.Profile.findAll({
            include: [{
                model: db.Status,
                attributes: ['jobId', 'accepted'],
                where: {
                    jobId: req.params.employerId,
                    accepted: 1
                }
            }],

        }).then(function (result) {
            res.json(result);
        }).catch(function (err) {
            console.log(err);
        })
    });
}
```
> Used left join sequelize query to join Profile and status model so that each employer can keep track of all accepted profiles

## Technologies Used
- Git - version control system to track changes to source code.
- GitHub - hosts repository that can be deployed to GitHub Pages.
- Javascript - allows dynamic interaction between user and computer data entry.
- JQuery - a javascript library that allows for simple yet more diverse and less verbos.
- NODE.js - javascript run-time environment that can be run outside of browser.
- Inquirer - command line user interfaces.
- Sequelize - Capture all the data and store into a table.
- Express - A node package for server hosting.
- MVC - Model, Views, Controller
- Node.js - Backend server.
- BCrypt - Used for hashing and comparing passwords.
- jQuery - A library used for server communication.
- Bootstrap - Used to help create our UI.
- HTML - Backbone of the site.
- CSS - For additional styling.


## Learning Points 
- Introducing a new library BCrypt which was used for hashing and comparing passwords
- Utilizing comments with our code to help during merging of back and front ends
- Using a personal server to store our data instead of relying on a third party
